# PulseEffects-Preset
This is my preset for [PulseEffects](https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects) on Linux.

* **Normalizer** - A volume normalizer without Auto-Gain plugin. Useful if you're looking for a steady sound level in high dynamic contents like movies when you don't want to adjust volume too many times. It's similar to **loudness equalization** in Windows.
